Superbasic LaTex > mathml passer

Needs alot of work to tidy up and learn the codeing system beter

VERY MUCH INCOMPLETE
-missing most of the LaTex funcitions and by proxy the mathml ones
-"^" is not working need to redo the rule sets for it

-well 12 hours to write after just knowing helloworld isnt that bad
